Hi, I’m Elias Nikkari

I’m interested in Fullstack development and I'm working my hardest to become a software engineer.

Currently I am learning Angular framework to work on a project in my summer internship as a software developer.

Looking forward to any and all projects.

You can reach me easily on LinkedIn: Elias Nikkari.
